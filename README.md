# AWS RDS App Runner with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform scripts to set up an AWS environment including RDS and App Runner. Follow the instructions below to deploy the infrastructure and get started with your application.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate IAM permissions
- Docker installed for building container images
- Access to an AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Terraform Variables

Before proceeding, make sure to update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your specific configuration settings such as AWS region, database credentials, and any other variables necessary for your setup.

### Step 2: Docker Image Preparation

1. **Build your Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your-image-name> .
   ```

2. **Authenticate Docker to your ECR**:
   Use the following command to authenticate Docker to your Elastic Container Registry:
   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com
   ```

3. **Push the Docker image to ECR**:
   Tag and push your Docker image to the ECR:
   ```bash
   docker tag <your-image-name>:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<your-repository-name>:latest
   docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<your-repository-name>:latest
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy with Terraform

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Navigate to the directory containing your Terraform files and run:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Plan the deployment**:
   View the changes that Terraform will apply to your AWS environment:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply the deployment**:
   Execute the plan to create the resources:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your Dockerfile is present in the root or specify its location in the `docker build` command.
- Carefully review and update the `terraform.tfvars` file before starting the Terraform commands to reflect your environment's specifics.
  
For more information on using Terraform and AWS Services like RDS and App Runner, refer to the official documentation.
